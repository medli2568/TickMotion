In the command prompt navigate to the folder where your python file is located, then type first command: pip install pyinstaller and process. If you do not have the latest version of pip, you can easily upgrade it by typing: python –m pip --upgrade pip. Sometimes, an Environment Error occurs, in this case we suggest to copy TickMotion.py (python file) into folder: venv – Scripts (in this folder you can find some additional apps and files necessary for this command). Finally, the python file is transformed into .exe file by typing: pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole TickMotion.py. You will find the application as a single .exe file in the folder dist (if you can´t see the dist folder, try to open the folder that contains your python file again). Note that if you are using computers with Linux or Mac OS X operational program, the working environment may differ.
