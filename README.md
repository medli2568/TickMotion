# InsectMotion
A user-friendly application that helps analyze muscle contractions and other movements from the video files.
Originally developed to analyze movements in Insects, however it can be applied to detect any movement in the video.
This app offers 2 analyses:
  one produce data (numbers) that reflect the intensity of movements in the selected ROI;
  another produce png image that visualize active (white) vs. inactive (black) pixels.
Both analyses are customizable, allowing users to optimize the settings to best fit the requirements of their experiment.
